## BubblAndroid

BUBBL is an application that works similarly to a to-do list. Users can input tasks that they have to do, along with a location and due date and time, and a user-set priority. The application takes these inputs and runs them through an algorithm that outputs an overall priority number. Tasks are then stored in an ArrayList and sorted by overall priority number. These tasks are then displayed, with the highest priority tasks being at the top of the list.
